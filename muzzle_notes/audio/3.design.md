## Design

[[docs/audio/mz_audio.h]] is a header-only library and is a part of the Muzzle Suite. It is not imported by default, but you can include it by defining `MZ_SUPPORT_AUDIO`

```c
#define MZ_DEPS
#define MZ_SUPPORT_AUDIO
#include <Muzzle.h> // Now it imports mz_audio.h and defines any required macros

/*
*
* code goes here
*
*/
```
